# e.g. x = 5, No syntax
# Example for loop
# for i in range (5)
#   print ("x")
# There is no ending syntax, instead python is sensitive to indents, everything
# in the for loop with be under one indent, and a indent reset will signal that
# the code in the for loop has ended.

#Inputting values in the print box:
# e.g. x=input("enter a number: ")
# What is in the Quotations will be printed, and whatever number is inputted
# be assigned to x

#If/Elif/Else Statments:
#e.g. x=input("Pick a number between 1 and 5 ")
# if (x==3):
#   print("You got it right!")
# elif (x>3):
#   print("lower")
# else:
#   print ("Higher")
# You can have as many elif statements as you want
